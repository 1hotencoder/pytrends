PyGTrends
=========

Pseudo API for Google Trends 

Written for Python 3.3

Heavily based off Matt Reid's Google Trends API
https://bitbucket.org/mattreid9956/google-trend-api/overview

Which is in turn based off of Sal Uryasev's pyGTrends.

This program allows you to load a csv file with a list of terms to download csv's for.
